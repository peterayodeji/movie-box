# MOVIE BOX

[MovieBox](https://movie-box-loaded.netlify.app) is a movie discovery web application that allows users to search for movies, view details about them, and save their favorite movies.

To run this React project created with Vite locally, you'll need to follow the following steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official website if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/

2. **Create the React Project:**
   If you haven't already created your React project using Vite, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-vite-app --template vite
   ```

   This will create a new React project with Vite as the template.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-vite-app
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   In the project directory, install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**
   Start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the Vite development server, and you should see output in the terminal indicating that the server is running.

6. **Access Your React App:**
   By default, your React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to view your app.

That's it! You've successfully set up and run a React project created with Vite locally.
